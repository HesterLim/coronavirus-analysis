# Project Coronavirus Analysis

## Context 
WHO on 31 December 2019 was alered to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. This virus is unknown to the medical community, hence we do not know how the virus is going to spread and affect people.

Daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community and used the compile data from the excellent Kaggle community to provide some insights.

Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboard using the affected cases data which is a better visualization for up to date information regarding the virus.

## Content
This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus)).The data is available from 22 Jan 2020.

## Main Findings
- With the analysis shown that 95.82% of Coronavirus affected patients are still waiting to be cure, the current global effort to find a cure for this highly contagious virus are highly necessary.
- With just data from 22/1/2020 to 31/1/2020 which is 10 days, there is already a total of 35051 confirmed cases, it is sure a highly contagious virus that spread very quickly with an average of 3505.1 cases per day.
- Looking at the bar chart, China has the highest amount of patients followed by US, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
- We also observe an increase in confirmed patients as each day passes
- We can also observe that the number of confirmed cases is directly proportional to number of death patients and  the number of confirmed cases is directly proportional to the number of recovered patients. 
- Early data shows that the percentage of recovered patients(1.89%) are less than the percentage of deaths among the confirmed cases(2.28%).
